- NYX Token, named after the goddess of night, is a digital currency created with ERC 20, an Ethereum standard. NYXT will be launched on UNISWAP on December 31, 2021, at midnight Eastern Standard Time (the start of the New Year). NYXT is designed to be as simple as possible with control to be in the hands of the investors. 

All NYXT buy and sell transactions will have a tax of 8% divided as follows: 

2% to a charity wallet for an MS Foundation (Multiple Sclerosis)

2% to a charity wallet for Veterans of the US Armed Forces

2% will be redistributed to our loyal holders

1% will be burned to the Black Hole Wallet

1% will go to a Marketing/Donations wallet.

 

How NYXT Began

After years of friendship, our NYXT development team shared some extreme highs and lows (for lack of a better phrase) with each other after investing in cryptocurrency.

 As time progressed we saw Ethereum based project after project released with many different utilities. Some of these projects stayed true to their word, others not so much and well, some of them were just flat out rugs.  Having been victims of some of the rugs, as well as investing in tokens that didnâ€™t stick to their road maps, we decided to create NYX Token. 

We plan to keep this as simple as possible, but with a few surprises along the way. This token has not only the investor in mind, but also many others that will benefit from the utility of this coin.
